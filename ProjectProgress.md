|   1   | As an owner, I want a database so that the program can query and utilise it. |
|   2   | As a user, I want an interface so that I can add new flights with the correct and appropriate information. |
|   3   | As a user, I want an interface so that I can update current flights by being able to change certain flight information. |
|   4   | As a user, I want an interface so that I can delete flights that are redundant or have been mistakenly added. |
|   5   | As a user, I want a history interface so that I can see what changes have been made and to revert them. |
|   6   | As an owner, I want a graphically pleasing interface so that the app is attractive and appealing. |
